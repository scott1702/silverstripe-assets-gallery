# Testing

We use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for our unit testing. Before running the tests, first make sure you have all of the required dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

Now that you have the dependencies required for testing, running the tests is simple.

```
$ npm run test
```

If all is well, you should see a lot of green `PASS`s. For more information about test coverage, you can run the tests like so.

```
$ npm run coverage
```
